## Project Overview
Some schinetifc research indicates that there is bacteria found inside the human bellybutton that could be used to make meat like vegetrian patties as a substitute for hamburger meat. This project is meant to create a simple flask application, published via github pages, to show the results of the study. 
## Results
The website goes of the profile data of the test subjects in this study. The three charts below showcase data from a study examining belly button bacteria. Bar Chart: top ten different bacterias found within an individual participant's belly button. Gauge Chart: the amount of times per week the participant cleans/scrubs their belly button. Bubble Chart: showcases the different bacteria found in the participant's belly button and organizes the chart based on sample size of each bacteria. On the left there is a Demographic info chart and above it is the filter functions to select the subject number via a dropdown menu.

## Summary

I do not have the scientifc background to come up with any conclussions about the study. However, The site is a usufull tool to share data accross differenet members of the study group to examine the data themselves. It's basic and easy to use, and does work accross multiple platforms such as IOS and Andriod devices. 

As a personal sidenote. I hold my reservations on ever eating a burger made of someone elses belly button lint.
